                        The first car I owned when I finally recieved my driver's license at 16 years old was a
                        1996 Toyota Celica soft-top convertible. This was the sixth generation Celica (T200)
                        This car had a 2.2 liter inline 4 cylinder engine producing 130 hp @6000 rpm &amp; 145 lb-ft, 
                        a 4-speed automatic transmission and a FWD drivetrain. This little car may not look like it, 
                        but it was special to me as is any teenagers' first personal mode of transportation. The 
                        Toyota Celica was built in Tahara, Japan.

                     <p>
                        The second car I purchased after the sale of my first was a 2004 Subaru Impreza WRX. This car
                        has a huge cult following which comes from the winning legacy of Subaru's World Rally Championship
                        team which formed in 1989. It holds a 2.0 liter turbo-charged flat four cylinder engine producing 
                        227 hp @6000 rpm and 217 lb-ft pushed to the road through a 5-speed manual transmission and 
                        an AWD drivetrain. The subaru WRX is built in Gunma, Japan.

                     <p>
                        The third car in the story comes in the shape of one of the most iconic japanese sports cars
                        ever built: the Nissan 240SX, a 1997 S14 silvia spec in this case. The nissan has a 2.4 liter inline
                        4 cylinder engine producing 155 hp @5600 rpm and 160 lb-ft. The transmission was a 5-speed manual and
                        it had a rear-wheel drivetrain all of which made the 240SX massively desirable in the tuning and motorsport
                        communities. The Nissan 240SX was built in Kanagawa, Japan.

                     <p>
                        The 4th car on the timeline was an extremely popular off-roading SUV, the Toyota 4Runner. 
                        This example was a 2001 Limited model on 33-inch offroad capable tires and a 3 inch lift 
                        which were very helpful since I lived in the mountains of Boulder, Colorado at the time. The 4-runner
                        had a 3.4 liter V6 engine which produced 183 hp @4800 rpm and 217 lb-ft. The transmission was a 
                        4-speed automatic, the drivetrain 4 wheel drive with optional high, low, and differential lockers
                        for offroad use. The 4-runner was built in Tahara, Japan.

                     <p>
                        The 5th car on the timeline is the first of two in which I still own and drive. This is the 1998 Silverado
                        Z71 of the K1500 generation. The Silverado has been a reliable truck of choice for many Americans since it 
                        first came off the line. This specific model has a 5.7 liter Iron block V8 engine producing 
                        230 hp @4600 rpm and 285 lb-ft, plenty of power to pull a loaded trailer or fill the bed with 
                        heavy objects. The transmission is a 4-speed automatic, this truck is rear wheel drive with 
                        optional 4x4 capabilities. The Silverado was built in Flint, Michigan.

                        2001 Chevrolet Corvette Z06 (2020-Present)
                     </h2>
                     <p>
                        The 6th vehicle on the list is my personal favorite that I have owned. The most legendary American sports
                        car ever built: the Corvette. This Corvette is of the fifth (C5) generation and is the Z06 
                        model. The Z06 is a high performance version of the corvette, which contains the 5.7 liter LS6
                        V8, producing 405 hp @6000 rpm and 400 lb-ft. The corvette has a T56 6-speed manual transmission
                        and a rear wheel drivetrain. All of these performance enhancing features propel the Z06 to cover
                        the 1/4 mile in 12.4 seconds, which matches even Ferrari and Lamborghini models of the time. The
                        Corvette was built in Bowling Green, Kentucky.
